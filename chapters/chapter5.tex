\section{Planned Works}

In order to complete this dissertation study, several steps will be taken.  First, the inclusive cross section will be finished.  With those results in hand, we will begin photon identification and neutral pion identification.  Once we have particle identifiation methods, we can select SIDIS events and calculate the kinematic quantities needed for the cross section.  Acceptance corrections and radiative corrections will be performed to the events and the cross section will be produced.  Finally, we will perform an analysis of systematic errors in our analysis.  It is anticipated that this analysis will be completed Spring 2018.
