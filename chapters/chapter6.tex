\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
TMD physics is currently the subject of interest for many nuclear physicists.  In this document, we have described our ongoing research efforts to make an impact in this sub-field.  Specifically, we propose that this dissertation project will (1) extract the structure function $F_{LU}^{\sin\phi}$ for positive kaons, (2) take steps necessary to extend a current CLAS measurement of unpolarized SIDIS azimuthal modulations to the absolute (SIDIS) cross section, and (3) provide an extraction of TMD functions (put the names here) within the EVA framework and a physics model.  Our work on both (1) and (2) is now at an advanced stage, and the remaining tasks have been briefly described in the document above.
