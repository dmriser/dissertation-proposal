\section{Kaon Beam Spin Asymmetry}

In addition to the unpolarized structure functions which will be accesable from the SIDIS cross section measurement, we extracted measured the beam spin asymmetry for positively charged k-mesons in SIDIS.  This gives us access to an additional structure function $F_{LU}^{\sin\phi}$.  The measurement was performed as a function of $\phi_h$ and 4 different kinematic variables $x$, $Q^2$, $z$, and $P_T$.  \\

In order to measure kaons in the kinematically accepted DIS region, we exclude events with have $Q^2 < 1$ or which have $W < 2$.  Additionally, if the axis of measurement is not $z$, we limit the range of $z$ values included in the sample to 0.25-0.75.  This cut is used as an attempt to make our measurement in the current fragmentation region where factorization has been proved.  

\subsection{Helicity Determination}
The beam helicity is measured periodically with a Moller polarimeter.  These measurements were analyzed statistically by Wes Gohn and it was observed that the average beam polarization was 75\%, with a variance of appriximately 1\%.
