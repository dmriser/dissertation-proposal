\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
In this document, I have described my ongoing research efforts to make an impact in the field of nucleon structure research.  Specifically, we propose that this dissertation project will (1) extract the structure function $F_{LU}^{\sin\phi}$ for positive kaons, (2) take steps necessary to extend a current CLAS measurement of unpolarized SIDIS azimuthal modulations to the absolute (SIDIS) cross section, and (3) utilize existing phenomenology and modeling to predict these measurements.  My work on both (1) and (3) is now at an advanced stage, and the remaining tasks have been briefly described in the document above.
