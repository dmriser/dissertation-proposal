This dissertation aims to increase understanding of proton structure by extracting Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions (TMD PDF).  This is accomplished by performing an experimental data analysis of the unpolarized cross section for Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS), as well as Kaon SIDIS beam spin asymmetry measurements.  The results are analyzed in EVA, a software that the author has been involved in writing that is designed for the extraction of TMD functions from world data using modern data analysis techniques.
