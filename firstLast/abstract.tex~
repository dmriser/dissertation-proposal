This dissertation will present measurements of the differential cross section for $e p \rightarrow e \pi^{\pm} X$ over a large kinematic range ($0.1 \leq x \leq 0.6$, $1.0 \leq Q^{2} \leq 4.8$, $0 \leq P_{T}^{2} \leq 1$).  Our analysis is performed on data taken by the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab (JLab) during the E1-F rungroup in 2003.  This experimental run was performed at beam energy $E_{Beam} = 5.498$ GeV with longitudinally polarized electrons which were incident on unpolarized liquid hydrogen.  The results are analyzed phenomenologically and TMD PDF's are extracted from this analysis.
